Dave,0,Room- Home,OnEnterRoomAfterFade,Oh no! My basement is flooded!,Gosh Durnit! My basement flooded again!,"Now that you played the game, let's look at this from a medical perspective and consider the treatment of heart failure (CHF)",
Dave,41,Room- Home,OnEnterRoomAfterFade,Good thing I have my trusty bucket!,I think I have a bucket 'round here somewhere...,Lets consider the hardware store in the first run as a drug store or an urgent care center (for Medical Supplies/Meds/Equipment),"If you were treating heart failure, you might consider using a Diuretic! This would improve urine output"
Narr,30,Room- Home,OnEnterRoomAfterFade,,,,The diuretic is over on the shelf. Click on it to add it to your inventory.
Dave,2,Room- Home,OnLookAtHotspotDoor,It's a door to the outside.,,,
Dave,44,Room- Home,OnUseInvPropWater,Oh man... this is going to take forever.,,"This is a situation that requires some urgent intervention. So, we go to the Medical Supply (hardware store)",
Dave,45,Room- Home,OnUseInvPropWater,Maybe there's something at Doc's hardware store that can help.,,,
Narr,28,Room- Home,OnUseInvPropWater,Click on a space in the room to walk to it.,,,
Dave,6,Room- Home,OnUseInvPropWater,This bucket ain't gonna cut it...,,,Looks like the patient will need more than a diuretic
Narr,2,Room- Home,OnUseInvPropWater,"Congratulations! The water level has decreased. However, it is not enough...",,"So, lets consider the bucket to represent some basic changes you could make like cutting down on salt, controlling diabetes better, cutting down or quitting smoking. But from the situation described we clearly need to make additional interventions ",
Dave,4,Room- Home,OnUseInvPropWater,"This is too hard! I think the handle is too short and the diameter of the hose is too small, I need to go back to the hardware store.",,,My basement's flooded. Got anything to help with that?
Dave,5,Room- Home,OnLookAtPropWater,That's a lot of water!,,"So, you got the pump (we will use the pump to represent the heart) and now we need to consider what is Heart Failure or CHF? Like the basement flooding, it can be thought of as a back up of water within the body. By definition heart failure occurs when the heart cannot or does not pump enough blood to needs of the body. ",
Narr,36,Room- Home,UpdateBlocking,Walk all the way to the right and click the door to leave your basement.,,,
Dave,46,Room- Home,UpdateBlocking,Finally! We got that dang water outta my dang basement!,,"Objectively, the amount of blood the heart pumps is called the cardiac output. It is the product of the Stroke Volume (how much blood the heart pumps with each beat multiplied by the number of beats per minute (heart rate). The normal (average) adult heart pumps about 5 liters of blood per minute. This is about 70 ml of blood with each beat times an average heart rate of 70 beats per minute (4900 ml or 4.9 liters/minute)",
Dave,47,Room- Home,UpdateBlocking,I sure hope that never happens again!,,,
Narr,53,Room- Home,UpdateBlocking,Two weeks later...,,,
Narr,2,Room- Home,OnInteractPropPump,"Congratulations! The water level has decreased. However, it is not enough...",,,
Dave,4,Room- Home,OnInteractPropPump,"This is too hard! I think the handle is too short and the diameter of the hose is too small, I need to go back to the hardware store.",,"So, now lets look at our bilge pump (the heart) and evaluate the handle and the length of the handle. From the first run of the game, we can see that when you went back to the hardware store and got a longer handle that improved the situation. This is because the longer handle improves the ""stroke volume"" which is the amount of water you pumped with each cycle on the pump. ",The stroke volume isn't enough! What about afterload??
Dave,25,Room- Home,OnInteractPropPump,I'm pooped! I need some extra muscle.,,,
Dave,26,Room- Home,OnInteractPropPump,"I bet my friend Tony could help out, I should give him a call.",,,
Narr,3,Room- Home,OnInteractPropPump,You've chosen the correct parts for the pump and the water level has decreased.,,,"By using the Large Handle, you have increased the stroke volume of the pump (heart)"
Dave,7,Room- Home,OnInteractPropPump,Still not enough... I could use some extra hands.,,"So, while the increase in stroke volume is helpful. we need to maintain the rate as the cardiac output (or in our situation) the amount of water pumped out of the basement is a product of the stroke volume and the rate or how fast you are pumping. I am going to equate the rate and force of the person using the pump to ""muscle"", in this case heart muscle. As you tire out, you pump more slowly and with less force on the handle (or physiologically with less contractile force). ",One of the ways to improve heart failure is to recruit more muscle with medication or other methods
Dave,8,Room- Home,OnInteractPropPump,This isn't any better. I should try different parts.,,,"Physiologically speaking, what else can you do to improve heart function?"
Tony,0,Room- Home,OnInteractCharacterTony,Here goes nothing!,,,
Narr,4,Room- Home,OnInteractCharacterTony,The recruited muscle has helped bring the water level down.,,"Resting, helps you to regain your strength but the heart does not have the option of taking a break. It just gets more tired. However, the treatment principle is the same. One of the components of treating heart failure is to ""recruit more muscle"" (cardiac muscle). This can be achieved through improving the ability of the heart muscle to pump. This could be done by using a drug like digoxin which increases cardiac muscle contractility in combination with a diuretic (like HCTZ) which helps the kidneys to eliminate more water. This also improves the curve of of cardiac contractility (The Starling Curve)",Having your friends help in the basement is medically like recruitment of more heart muscle (improving pumping efficiency)
Tony,4,Room- Home,OnInteractCharacterTony,Phew... I'm wiped out. Got any grub?,,,
Narr,5,Room- Home,OnInteractCharacterNeighbor2,Jim helps get some more water out by scooping it out the window with his bucket. Equivalent to using a diuretic.,,"Now lets consider what we have done so far. We improved stroke volume (the longer pump handle) and we recoginzed the need to recruit more muscle with digoxin and improving the ""Starling Curve"" by adding a diuretic. Now lets get back to the game",
Narr,6,Room- Home,OnInteractCharacterNeighbor2,30 minutes later...,,,
Neighbor2,0,Room- Home,OnInteractCharacterNeighbor2,"Phew, I'm exhausted",,"You are tired of working pump so in our game, the recruitment of extra muscle is getting our friends to help us out. We use our BIG friend Dave as a representation of heart muscle recruitment. Also, in our game we are using the ""pizza and beer"" as a representation of drugs like Digoxin as feeding Dave helps him to maintain his ability to work the pump and not decide to leave us to go and get pizza and beer himself.",
Dave,9,Room- Home,OnInteractCharacterNeighbor2,Me too. We could use some extra muscle.,,,
Narr,34,Room- Home,OnInteractPropBucket,Bucket added to your toolbox.,,"Now, that we have improved stroke volume, muscle contractility, and maintained an effective heart rate (by having a well-fed, well-rested friend working the pump since you got tired. Let's consider trying to decrease the amount of work the heart has to do. So, lets imagine that you accidently stepped on the hose which goes from the pump to the basement window where your friend is now pumping water out. When you step on the hose, the pump suddenly gets a lot harder to use, or to push the handle because of the obstruction created by you stepping on the hose.",
Dave,42,Room- Home,OnInteractPropBucket,There it is! Now I can scoop up some of this water.,,,
Narr,32,Room- Home,OnInteractPropBucket,Click on the bucket icon in your toolbox to select it.,,"Remember when you played the game the first time, your visit to the hardware store allowed you to get a longer handle and a larger diameter hose. What happens if you had a larger diameter hose? This would allow more water to flow through the hose with less pressure needed to do it. The more pressure you need to generate to pump the water, the more ""work"" you do, the harder it is. ",
Dave,43,Room- Home,OnLookAtPropBucket,There's my bucket! I can use that to scoop out the water.,,,"Medically, consider the bucket to be a Diuretic (It helps the kidneys get rid of excess fluid)"
Dave,44,Room- Home,OnUseInvHotspotWindow,Oh man... this is going to take forever.,,,
Dave,45,Room- Home,OnUseInvHotspotWindow,Maybe there's something at Doc's hardware store that can help.,,"The larger diameter hose you got from the hardware store is physiologically like giving some medication (a vasodilator) which will decrease what is called ""afterload"". Afterload is the resistance the heart must pump against. So, decreasing the afterload (getting a larger diameter hose) decreases the work of the heart.",
Narr,37,Room- Home,OnUseInvHotspotWindow,Click on a space in the room to walk to it.,,,

Tony,5,Room- Home,OnUseInvCharacterTony,Pizza AND beer?!,,,
Tony,6,Room- Home,OnUseInvCharacterTony,Just what I needed!,,,
Narr,54,Room- Home,OnInteractPropBox,Repair Kit added to your toolbox.,,"Hey, I also got a tool kit from the hardware store. Excellent, this is used to repair the bilge pump. Lets imagine the pump develops a leaky washer and some amount of water leaks around the valve and splashes out of the pump back into the basement. This reduces the effectiveness of the pumping process as some amount of water winds up back in the basement and is not going out the window. Physiologically, if we consider the heart as a pump, these new washers in the tool kit help to improve the ""forward flow"" of the water and prevent backup. This is also an important principle in the treatment of heart failure. In the heart leaky valves can be a contributing factor or cause of heart failure and sometimes a valve replacement of a leaky or ""stenotic"" (narrowed) valve can be helpful. Replacement of a ""stenotic"" or narrowed aortic valve would be like your friend telling to get your foot off the hose as you are inhibiting the flow and making him work harder.",
