		You can check the current time remaining on a timer by calling the `GetTimer(string name)` function, using the same name used to start the timer.

		Pass time as 0 to disable a currently running timer.

		**NOTE:** the timer will not tick while the game is paused.
		
		**Example:**

		    `E.Timer("egg",6) );`

		Will set the timer "egg" to expire after 6 seconds

		**Rolling your own timers:**
		AGS users are familiar with the SetTimer() function, which is why it is included. However, it's good to know how to make your own timers, it's a fundamental building block of game coding! 

		This is how most coders would implement a simple timer:

		In your script body or header, add a float variable:
	        float m_myTimer = 0;

		When you want to start a timer, in an interaction script for example:
		    m_myTimer = 4; // Set to 4 seconds

		And in your Update function:
		~~~
		    if ( m_myTimer > 0) // If the timer is started
		    {
		        m_myTimer -= Time.deltaTime; // Subtract the time since last update
		        if ( m_myTimer <= 0 ) // Check if the timer's elapsed
		        {
		            // The timer has elapsed! Do something!
		        }
		    }
		~~~

	Notes:
	- The object to be saved must be a class containing the data to be saved (can't just pass in a value type like an int, float or Vector2).
	- By default all data in a class is saved, except for:
		- GameObjects, and MonoBehaviours
		- Variables with the [QuestDontSave] attribute (NOTE: THIS IS NOT YET IMPLEMENTED, BUG DAVE IF NEEDED!)
		- If you store references to other things that shouldnt be saved in your scripts, that may cause problems. Best thing is to dave know, he can add a feature tohelp with that
	-  you can add the [QuestSave] attribute to the class
		- When you do that, ONLY the variables that also have the [QuestSave] attribute are saved.
		- You can put this tag on a Monobehaviour class, when you just want to save a few of its variables without having to put them in their own seperate class
